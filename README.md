#### How to Port
1. Download Unity and your selected port (Linux,Mac,etc)
2. Download the latest version (main)
3. Open it in Unity
4. Click Build Settings
5. Select the OS you want to port the game to
6. Click [Build] or [Build & Run]
7. Run it!

## Modding
Modding is allowed, that's the reason why it's open source!
Currently, Modding requires Unity. JaUV (or me) is trying his best to add mods to the base game.
For now, the only way to mod the game is to learn C# and download Unity.
#### How to Mod
1. Download Unity
2. Download the latest version (main)
3. Open it in Unity
4. Learn C# (watching Brackeys!)
5. Do your modding stuff (usually takes 1-2 weeks)
6. Refer to  no. 4 in How to Port
